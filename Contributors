The ClearOS distribution would not be possible without the hard work and
dedication of a large number of talented people. It's only fair that we
acknowledge the time and effort that they have put into the distribution.

We are always in need of more volunteers. If you're interested in joining
the ClearOS Project, please join us on irc.freenode.net in #clearfoundation


## Special Recognition ## 

One of the key reasons we got delayed on the ClearOS-6 release was lack of 
suitable build resources, especially when we had to repeatedly build large
chunks of code. Shad L came forward and worked with us to setup a large
build cluster, then tune the build process and help improve the overall
build, test and validate process we were using.

Having this capability was key in our ability to build, test and deliver
ClearOS-7 as rapidly as we have been able to.
